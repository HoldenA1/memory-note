# Memory Note

I plan for this project to be a simple flashcard PWA that stores data locally within the browser. I will be using IndexDB for the data storage.

## Todo

- [x] Create add deck functionality
- [x] Add error notification when deck cannot be created
- [x] Clean up js code and move to database.js for reusability
- [ ] Update flashcard creation to work with new database
- [ ] Make styling consistent across pages
- [ ] Add noscript tags to notify users that JS is required for the app to work
- [ ] Add manifest and service workers to make offline capable
- [ ] Theme switching (dark, light, and system)
- [ ] Research and implement spaced repetition system
